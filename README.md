# Neural-Networks
Neural Networks from Scratch implements perceptron and multi-layer perceptron models using only Python and NumPy. Features include forward/backward propagation, custom loss functions (MSE, BCE), batch gradient descent with hyperparameter tuning, and Matplotlib visualizations for training loss, accuracy, and decision boundaries.
